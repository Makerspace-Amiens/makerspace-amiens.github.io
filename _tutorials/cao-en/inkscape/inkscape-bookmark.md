title="1 - Creating Basic Shapes"
content="We will start by creating the different elements that will make up your bookmark. Start by drawing two rectangles and adjust the rounded corners. 

The large rectangle will form the outline of your bookmark and will have dimensions of 35 x 170 mm.

The second rectangle will serve as a tool for the edges of your bookmark. It will have dimensions of 25 x 160 mm. Leave it aside for now, we will use it later."

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="2 - Importing Images"
content="To create our pattern, we will use black and white images. You can find shapes of this type on the website [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com). 

In our example, we will use [leaf shapes from a gallery](https://thenounproject.com/browse/collection-icon/leafs-glyph-icons-56482/?p=1), but you can, of course, choose your own designs. However, you should have at least 4 with sufficient differences to create an interesting pattern."

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="3 - Vectorizing Images"
content="For now, your images are in a raster format. We will now need to transform these images into vectors, allowing us to later work with Inkscape's vector modification tools. To do this, use the **Trace Bitmap** tool in **Path**, just like in the previous tutorial.

Vectorize all the images to only retrieve the vector shapes. You can then delete the images; we won't need them anymore."

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="4 - Positioning and Dimensions"
content="Gather your shapes and adjust the dimensions so that they can at least fit within the width of your bookmark. We will use them later as a template for the **Spray Clones** tool."
image="inkscape_NVAblHOHfB.png" %}

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="5 - Spray Clones"
content="We will now use the **Spray Clones** tool to duplicate our shapes in a more *organic* manner. To do this, select your shapes and then click on the tool in the right-hand menu bar ![Alt text](inkscape_U0zgw63A6v.png).

Adjust the settings according to your needs and the look you want to achieve. For a trial, the settings chosen for our example are indicated below (right-click, open in a new tab):

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="6 - Correcting Positions"
content="After spraying, it's highly likely that several shapes overlap. You could adjust manually, but Inkscape has a tool to correct this and save you some time.

In **Object**, go to the **Align and Distribute** tool. Then select your generated shapes and use the **Randomize centers** tool multiple times ![Alt text](inkscape_XOaJy3wcyX.png).

Once the result is close to what you want, finish the finer adjustments manually and remove the shapes outside the rectangle."
image="inkscape_EQVBrnYtTj.gif" %}

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="7 - Merging Shapes"
content="Now that you have your shapes, you will use the **Path > Union** tool to unify all the shapes. Once this is done, select the green rectangle, then the blue rectangle and in the **Align and Distribute** tool, select **Relative to: First selected** then click on the horizontal and vertical centering icons ![Alt text](inkscape_GWltfUtA5W.png)![Alt text](inkscape_z1hfqERlQT.png)

Finally, select your shapes along with the blue rectangle and choose the **Intersection** merge mode ![Alt text](inkscape_yJPAUnjdcK.png)"

{% include step-tuto.html 
title="8 - Final Touches"
content="You're almost done with this mini-project. You can now add a shape of your choice on top and modify the stroke colors. This will not affect the cutting but will give you a better visual rendering of your project. For example, you can make the following choices:

- Cutting outline in red
- Engraving outline in black
- Inside engraved in black"

## Laser Cutting

All that's left is to save your file so that you can later have it cut on the MakerSpace laser.
