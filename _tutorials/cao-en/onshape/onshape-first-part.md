## Objective:

![](2022-09-08-09-17-59.png)

The objective of this tutorial is to discover the basic functions of OnShape by step-by-step creating the part shown above. All the functions used are not exhaustively explained, so feel free to test some options yourself.

Then click on **Midpoint** in the constraint toolbar ![](2022-09-07-15-03-03.png).

#### Method 2: by Symmetry
You can also center the square using double symmetry. Click on two opposite vertices of the square and then on the line separating them:

## Modifying Your Part

CAD tools are inherently parametric tools. This means that they allow you to make modifications to your parts by going back through your construction tree. This allows you to correct or add elements to your part by going back up your tree without having to redo your entire design.

For example, in our case, we will make several modifications:

{% include step-tuto.html 
greyBackground = true
title="MOD 1: Base Dimension"
content="In this first modification, we will change the size of the sketch, and then we will modify the height of the base.

Double-click on your first sketch (the one for your base). You will return to **Sketch Editing** mode for your base. Change the dimension of your square side to **40mm** ![](2022-09-08-09-24-28.png), then **Validate** ![](2022-09-07-15-17-39.png) to exit.

To modify your base height, double-click on the extrusion of your base in the construction tree, and change the height to 5mm, then **Validate** ![](2022-09-07-15-17-39.png) to exit.

title="MOD 2: Hole Dimensions"
content="Double-click on the hole sketch to enter edit mode, and change the circle diameter to 4mm and the distance from the center to 16mm, then **Validate** ![](2022-09-07-15-17-39.png) to exit.
