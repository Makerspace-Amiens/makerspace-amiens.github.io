# 1. Introduction

Onshape is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that can be used directly in a browser.

It heavily utilizes cloud computing, with processing and rendering performed on remote servers. Users can interact with the system via a web browser or iOS and Android apps. As a SAAS system, Onshape upgrades are released directly to the web interface, and the software requires no maintenance work from the user.

Onshape allows teams to collaborate on a single shared design, much like multiple editors can work together to edit a shared document via cloud services. It is primarily focused on mechanical CAD (MCAD) and is used for product and machine design in many sectors, including consumer electronics, mechanical machinery, medical devices, 3D printing, machine parts, and industrial equipment.
