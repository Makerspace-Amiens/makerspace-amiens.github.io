# 1. Overview

Onshape is a computer-aided design (CAD) software, usable directly in a web browser.

It heavily utilizes cloud computing, with processing and rendering performed on remote servers. Users can interact with the system via a web browser or iOS and Android apps. As a SAAS system, Onshape upgrades are released directly to the web interface and the software requires no maintenance work from the user.

Onshape allows teams to collaborate on a single shared design, in much the same way as multiple editors can work together to edit a shared document via cloud services. It primarily focuses on mechanical CAD (MCAD) and is used for product and machine design in many sectors, including consumer electronics, mechanical machinery, medical devices, 3D printing, machine parts, and industrial equipment.
