SolidWorks is a commercial software application for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided engineering (CAE), developed by Dassault Systèmes.

SolidWorks is widely used by companies of all sizes to help innovate and grow their business. SolidWorks products are easy to learn and use, and work together to help you design products more efficiently, faster, and more cost-effectively.

SolidWorks develops and markets 3D CAD design software, analysis software, and product data management software. It is part of the 3DEXPERIENCE Works portfolio that unites your entire ecosystem, allowing you to connect people, applications, and real-time data from every aspect of your business.

In addition to 3D design, SolidWorks also offers simulation features, product data management (PDM), and free CAD tools (eDrawings, Composer Player, SolidWorks Explorer). These additional tools are available for download and can be added to SolidWorks to enhance its capabilities.

SolidWorks is available for Windows and is licensed as a paid subscription. There is also an educational version of SolidWorks, intended for use by students and teachers in an academic environment.

SolidWorks was introduced by Dassault Systèmes in 1995. Since then, it has been continually improved and updated to meet the changing needs of the design and manufacturing industry.
